# SchoolsPLP PTO App

Uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS and SQL to bring everything together.

App should remain simple, it's just used to track PTO and for employees to log in and see how much PTO they have left until their work anniversary.

Everyone uses the same login page and depending on if you're flagged as an admin or an employee will depend on what page you're redirected to after logging in.

Admins have the ability to add new employees, create a username and password, add PTO entrys, see a PTO summary of how many days every added employee has left, see upcoming PTO and change PTO policies.

Employees only have the ability to see a read only page showing how many days they have alloted for the year, how many they have used, how many days they have left, a summary of the PTO dates they've used in the past AND the ability to see current PTO policies put in place by the company. Any changes made from admins are automatically updated to each employee.

Admins should only be Melanie and Leah.

Each employee should be given a secure password to log in with upon onboarding, just like a bundle we give for all the company logins.
