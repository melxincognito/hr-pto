        <h3>PTO Note</h3>
        <p>
          All PTO requests must be approved by your direct supervisor in
          advance. Please note that there are peak periods—particularly from
          July 15 to September 15, which coincide with the start of the school
          year—during which PTO may be limited or not approved due to
          operational needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, employees are not eligible to use PTO within the first
          <b> 90 days</b> of employment and the use of your full PTO allowance
          within the first six months of employment may not be permitted.
          Approval will be based on business needs and manager discretion.
          <b>
            Our PTO bucket is a combined pool for both sick days and personal
            days off. We do not have separate buckets, so you can use your PTO
            as needed for either type of absence.

                SchoolsPLP recognizes the importance of taking leave when there
                is a death in the family. You are entitled to take up to 3 days
                off with pay for the funeral of an immediate relative. Pay is
                based on the regular rate for an eight-hour day. Authorized
                leave without pay is available for extended funeral matters.
                Personal leave time may also be taken when necessary. Notify
                Human Resources of your intention to take bereavement leave as
                soon as the need arises. The Company may request documentation
                to support absences for bereavement leave.
